# A personal website example

Hello, this is a personal website example, built with
Sphinx, MyST markdown and sphinx-book-theme.

## Why would anyone build their personal website with Sphinx?
There are two main reasons: first is it can, and second is most Python projects
(including python itself) use Sphinx, so you don't need to learn yet another tool/framework
for your blog.
Everything you learn contributing to Python project docs will be useful to your website,
and everything you learn setting your website will be useful when contributing to OSS docs.
